h1. UUnit

UUnit is a simple xUnit-style framework for unit testing inside Unity IDE. More info at "unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=UUnit":http://www.unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=UUnit .

License info pending, but it will likely be some kind of "free to use, as long as you give me credit" type of deal. It is on GitHub, after all.

# @cd@ into the Assets directory (or a subdirectory of your choice).
# Follow the GitHub help page at "help.github.com/forking":http://help.github.com/forking/ .
